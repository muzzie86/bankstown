Bankstown City Council Scraper
------------------------------

Bankstown City Council site is very easy to scrape, only need to scape a single page to get the entire month of DAs. No pagination, yay... Three cheers to Bankstown City Council !!!

However, the lack of HTML class, id, etc to identify the data, it requires a few 'explode' in PHP to get the right information.

By default: it will look for 'thisweek' of DAs, for data recovery you can set the MORPH_PERIOD=thismonth or MORPH_PERIOD=lastmonth

Still, not bad...Thanks and Enjoy
